InputProject

Project for figuring out how to get input from different controllers in Unity.

Made using Unity version 2018.3.2f1, on Windows (for Windows). Implementation 
assumes that Input.GetJoystickNames gives connected controllers in order
(Input.GetJoystickNames[0] = joystick 1 etc.) Not too reliable, might not
work on platforms other than Windows.
